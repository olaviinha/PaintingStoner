# Painting Stoner

Painting Stoner is a simple tool for optimizing projection aided painting. I.e. when you use a real-life projector to project a digital image on your real-life canvas for real-life painting. Its power lies in two features: 
1. Free perspective transform of image. This enables to keystone your image to your canvas no matter where your projector is positioned or what kind of keystoning features it has. Optional guidelines are present for more accurate transform positioning.
2. In addition to basic opacity control, this includes an animated auto-fading of image with individual on-screen settings for fade in time, fade out time, on-screen time and off-screen time.

Tested only in [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com).

## Howto
