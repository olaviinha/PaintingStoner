# Painting Stoner

Painting Stoner is a simple tool for optimizing projector guided painting. I.e. when you use a real-life projector to project a digital image on your real-life canvas for real-life painting, whether you use projecting for making a rough sketch, learning perspectives or just taking a shortcut through time.

Its power lies in two key features:
1. **Free perspective transformation of image.** This enables you to keystone the image to your canvas despite the projector position or what kind of keystoning features it has. Optional guidelines are present for more accurate transform positioning.
2. **Extended opacity control with animated auto-fading.** In addition to basic opacity slider, the Stoner includes an opacity range slider where you can select two opacity values. You can easily switch between these values when necessary by clicking anywhere on page or hitting spacebar on your keyboard. You may also enable animated auto-fading between these opacity values according to duration settings (separately specified image fade time, image on-screen time and image off-screen time).

Other features include grayscale and contrast slider.

(Note that the fading animation is much smoother in reality than in this 4 frames per second gif.)

## Howto
1. Set up your projector to project on your canvas. Remember that this tool has excessive keystoning, so you may place your projector in a position where you normally might not – The Stoner will make up for any possible shortcomings in your projector's keystoning features.
2. Open [Painting Stoner](https://joku.asia/painting-stoner).
3. Drag any image file from your computer and drop it in the yellow square (yellow square will appear on page when you drag your file on the page). Alternatively you may directly paste an image or an image URL from your clipboard.
4. Click on the <i>Full screen</i> button to enter full screen mode.
5. Drag the big red corner dots to get the image on your canvas as you wish. Easiest way to go is to crop your image to the same aspect ratio as your canvas (using some other tools) – in this case you will simply drag the big red dots onto the corners of you canvas and you're done.
6. Adjust image effect and opacity settings to whatever you find most convenient for the situation at hand.
7. Start painting.
